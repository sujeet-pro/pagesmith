name: prj-diagramkit-auto
description: Automatically select the best diagramkit engine (Mermaid, Excalidraw, Draw.io, or Graphviz) for a given diagram task, then delegate to the engine-specific skill. Use when the user asks to create a diagram without specifying which engine, or when you need to decide between Mermaid, Excalidraw, Draw.io, or Graphviz.

# prj-diagramkit-auto

Follow the version-pinned skill that ships with the locally installed `diagramkit` package:

→ [`node_modules/diagramkit/skills/diagramkit-auto/SKILL.md`](../../../node_modules/diagramkit/skills/diagramkit-auto/SKILL.md)

Always anchor on the local install (`npx diagramkit ...`, never a global one). Read `node_modules/diagramkit/REFERENCE.md` first if you have not already.

Pagesmith-specific notes:

- After picking an engine and authoring the source file, put it in a sibling `diagrams/` folder next to the markdown that references it, then run `npm run render:diagrams` (not `npx diagramkit render .` directly) so the project-wide script is used.
- Follow the embed patterns in `.agents/skills/prj-docs-diagrams/SKILL.md` (use `<figure>` with `.only-light` / `.only-dark` for Pagesmith-rendered docs, `<picture>` for GitHub-facing READMEs).
